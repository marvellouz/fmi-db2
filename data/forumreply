Happened with the 6.3 Knoppix... So I wanna try Arch...Shylock made a nice Live distro, ArchBang, but it cannot be remastered and rebuilt so as to create an Iso and burn it into a CD (DVD ) with all the stuff that I want to put in there... can it...? Think of it as my "Lightweight" B-52, ROFL , as ArchBang would be a sort of Lightweight F23 Raptor... BRGDS Alex | 2 | 0

Arch used to be /dev/sda1 with /home on /dev/sda6. I have decided to hook up both my drives and now I have PClinux on /dev/sda1 with the home on /dev/sda6. I setup grub on PClinux to boot Arch on /dev/sdb1 without issue. Now the problem I have is when I boot Arch everything goes fine until I login as user. It gives some sort of can't find HOME= defaulting to default (home is on /dev/sdb6). I can't start X or anything. Anyone have any ideas without doing a re-install? | 3 | 2

I have setup oblogout, but the only buttons that work are Logout and cancel. I can't get shutdown, reboot, suspend, or lock to work. Any ideas? | 0 | 9
